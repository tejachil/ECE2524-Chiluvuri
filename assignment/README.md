###Relevance to Intro to Unix and Motive for Assignment
More often then not, I have found automation of various tasks to be one of the big things in Unix that comes mainly with experience. Whether you are writing code or manipulating a set of data, bash scripting makes tasks that you would manually do by opening each file individually a lot easier and more streamlined. I know in the industry when you are dealing with live data and live code, scripting is the only way tasks can be achieved without service interuption. I feel that scripting is particularly useful in developing code and this assignment allows students to experince that. As you are developing code, there are things that change and such as data file formats, company names, etc. When applications and projects get bigger and bigger, these changes are hard to implement manually by opening each file. In this case, scripting makes doing such repetitive tasks more streamlined.

In one of my internships, I had an emplyer who was oldschooled and very well versed in Unix and bash scripting. We were dealing with the companies website and had to make some changes to the website by adding some features and such. In this project, he used bash scripts extensively to move certain files around, to delete certain entries in files, to rename certain things and I found it quite useful and was in awe by how streamlined scripting was in automating such tasks.

###Point Distribution
I think most of the points (~80%) should be weighted towards the the functionality of the script. Scripts in industry aren't usually used by customers or end users but rather are there to help out the group or team. As a result, the script working is the most important part and there is not much concern of how streamlined or efficient it is. 

I think the rest of the points (~20%) should be weighted towards the coding style. It should check the script to make sure the tasks are achieved in a straight forward and somewhat efficient manner.
